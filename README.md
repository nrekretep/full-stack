# Full-Stack

## What?

If you look at the job ads in the IT sector it looks like "full-stack developer" is a very desirable job. 
Nearly every company is searching for a "full-stack developer". There seems to be a great need for the ones who reached the master level in developing the full-stack. 

But did you ever ask yourself what this magic full-stack thing is? So many recruiters out there seem to have requirements for the full-stack which need to be carved in code.

## Why?

Is full-stack the name of a platform, an application, a framework or a library? I do not know and even after googling for a while I could not find an answer. It must be a thing which can be developed because there is such a need for full-stack developers. 

Maybe you know what it is? If yes, please tell me. 

If not: I create my own answer with this project. 

> Full-Stack is the name of this project. Currently I am the only member of this project.
> And so I assume I can now call myself the first and only real full-stack developer ðŸ¦„.

## How?

If you also want to be a full-stack developer then come in and join me. 

## What Next?

Maybe we should ask the companies out there how the full-stack should look like? So we will have something to develop ...
